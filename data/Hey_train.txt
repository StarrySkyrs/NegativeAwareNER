returned, decided against this product
Awesome heater for the electrical requirements
Keeps the mist of your wood trim and on you
i installed this 10 months ago, instructions were easy and it worked well
What can I say it broke, and forgot the warranty to send it in
Much better than other brands
Not good for only hot water heater for house
I use this to make my matcha tea froth up
Work well
Good for overflow filter
Super fast and easy to install
I used these to hold the solar panel onto the roof of my cargo trailer
Was a little skeptical at first 
I bought this for my neighbor and he loves it
arrived in good shape
Super deal
good thenks
cheap made but works okay
If these don't make you smile ear to ear & have a warm heart, nothing will
super strong
I think these look very cool little fibers attached to the flake give off a cool sparkle
Fantastic item for Morris Canal and NJ history fans
Love this book
Great quality great value
Does the job
Quick delivery, no problems
Looks good and is functional
Work great
They work perfectly that's all I can say
Super great clip for the low price
I purchased this as a Christmas gift for friends who moved to a new home and it was very well received
SUPER quality item
strong and very durable with lots of pages
Exactly as explained-
A very nice dated Christmas ornament
Measurement advertised is incorrect
Beautiful
These work great
Great item, highly recommend
I use it to cover intakes for powerheads and outside filters
I searched all around for a sticker book for my children, but could only find junky ones, until this
This product works perfect, could not be better 
Light, flexible and adaptable
love this little light,  is as advertised,  works great
Works fine
Magnificent
Not my first book light, sad to admit, but this one offers:
Two levels of brightness, adjusted by pressing the button, Batteries included, A flexible neck that makes it easy to avoid hot spots on pages, and I just love the purple color
nice size,2nd one i own,bright enough for my purpose,lighting an exercise monitor with no backlite
Perfect for night reading
Excellent product
Excellent product
WIFE READS DAILY AND USES IT ALWAYS
Christmas gift for my grandson who loves to read
Great little reading light, at times it can be too bright next to someone in bed but it's better than a lamp or ceiling light
Smaller than I though but it is bright and light weight
This is the second one I have purchased
Wonderful little light, perfect for young and old
Great item - better quality than picture, very pleased
Handy but not quite bright enough and batteries run down fairly quickly
I have several books I need to read for an apprenticeship I'm beginning soon and the lighting in our house at night isn't good enough for reading
So much better than plastic mug types--keeps coffee warm and doesn't stain
I like my coffee hot; borderline scorching but drinkable
This mug does only a fair job of keeping coffee hot
This cup worked well
Have not used it often enough, but does what it is supposed to do, ie, keeps drinks hot AND does NOT leak
These mugs do what they are designed to do, i
I purchased two of these cups for camping but I like them so much I use one daily
Overall it is a nice mug
I love this mug
Very cool sticker book
Its a nice variation on the kids book and the little cookies disapear as you turn the pages
Purchased this book as a gift for the grandchildren, it has a cute story and the raised cookies are fun to count
This book is cute my 18 month old likes it
I originally only knew this story/song in French
This is so mini edition, that they should have written the word 'mini' in smaller print
Cute and fun way to introduce children to Spanish
Perfect
absolute fun
These seem great
christmas gift
good
I bought this for a Spanish teacher I know to help the students in her class with learning disabilities and the reluctant writers
I am learning Mandarin Chinese and my husband (who is Taiwanese) has been using these with me to leave messages on the fridge for me to translate and reply to
Worth the price
I struggle to make sentences that make sense, because my spanish isn't up to the task yet, but it is still fun to try
This is an interesting, audience-specific Magnetic Poetry word collection
I am a huge fan of these word games
Its certainly filled with innuendos
FUN GIFT for any college student
These are hilarious
this was alright
These are fun and some of my friends enjoy making up cheesy pickup lines to use at the bar
This magnetic fridge kit is pretty awesome
Fun words on the fridge
Why wouldn't this get 5 stars?
Bought this for my stepdaughter when she started college
Love the words
A plethora of words to make varied sentences
Funny
These are hilariously fun
While mostly coffee specific words, this kit will also add variety to other kits
I'm probably the most oblivious person possible - but I thought this was about cats when I bought it for a present
These are great, but not nearly as many f-bombs as one would expect
Great secret santa gift for a weather person
Fun
good words, could be more magnetic
As long as you know what your are buying here, this is a fun magnet set for your fridge
These are hilarious, and a big hit on our fridge
Lots of fun F bombs in this little box
nice set, really funny
great 
UPDATE: These have since come down as they were leaving small rusty scratches/marks on my stainless steel fridge
Perfect for recent grad headed for college with her magnetic white board
Ever want your fridge to be a little more
Gift for a friend, it was very well received
Fun
Smaller than expected but lots of fun when company is over
Gift for my guy friends' apartment
My beer making hubby loved it
Bought for my sons college home and it is a huge hit
Love these magnets
These things are so much fun
product as described, works well
Great fun
Fun
There were WAY more words than I expected in this little box
These are good but as others have said, they're better if you have a regular set of refrigerator magnets because this set, while containing a great mix of profanity, is lack a lot of structural content so it's hard to really make a sentence which takes away some of the novelty of having these magnets in the first place
Marvelous
This was a gift for my college-age granddaughter
Bought this for my secret santa giftee on reddit
So when I bought this I really could not wait to come up with many weird movie lines but sadly the lines given make it hard to create anything that sounds good
This was a great purchase
I find the Wilton yearbook's get worse every year
A nice book but is mainly for fondant and gum paste
This is the first Wilton yearbook I've ever purchased

was not like the old yearbooks
excellent working like new still from the day it was purchase up on till now

This book is the first I've bought for many years
I saw this book at Target and flipped through it
Excellent book
cute and made in America
These are great bought several different packs for my fridge
Was a gift for my brother and he is having tons of fun with this
Perfect Christmas gift
perfect for what I needed it for
Provided limited entertainment for holiday house guests
fun and festive
Great for kids learning to read
They weren't kidding about this being a little box
Students in my office exact comment: "These are great
love it
The price is waaaaay too high for this tiny tin (like about 1 inch x 2 inches) of even tinier magnets
